This is an idle, incremental clicker style game.
Simply click the resources to increase their count and then build more resources and buildings to automate getting resources.
Strongly inspired by my love of factorio.

Learnings:
- I learned a lot more about classes and inheritence. The items are of one class with properties such as name, a counter and what other items are required to build them. They also have methods to check if the required materials are available, and build it. The buildings inherit these features but also extra properties such as what they produce.
- I tried to my code much cleaner, it became very easy to actually add more properties later on to the classes when I started adding those features.
- Better understanding of modules and webpack.

Hadn't made my own game yet, so this was a really fun quick project to do, makes me want to try other very simple games such as an RPG with ascii art.
